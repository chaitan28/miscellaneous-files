#### Dockerfile = Environment+Dependencies+Source Code
################################
### Dockerfile 
- **FROM:** Specifies the base image to use for the Docker image.
```sh
 FROM ubuntu:20.04
```
- **ENV:** Sets environment variables.
```sh
 ENV APP_HOME=/usr/src/app APP_PORT=8080
```
- **LABEL:** Adds metadata to the image in the form of key-value pairs.
```sh
  LABEL maintainer="you@example.com" version="1.0"
```
- **USER:** Sets the user for the subsequent instructions and the CMD instruction.
 ```sh
 USER root
```
- **ARG:** Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command.
```sh
           FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk
           ARG JAR_FILE=target/anewtodo*.jar
           COPY ${JAR_FILE} /tmp/app.jar
           COPY target/index.html /tmp/index.html
           ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/tmp/app.jar"]
```
- **WORKDIR:** Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
```sh
WORKDIR $APP_HOME
```
- **COPY:**  Copies files or directories from the host to the container.
```sh
  COPY package.json ./ COPY . .
```
- **ADD:**  Copies files from a URL or tar archives and automatically extracts them.
```sh
 ADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/branch/file.txt /usr/src/app/file.txt
```
- **RUN:**  Executes a command during the image build process.
```sh
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
- **VOLUME:**  Creates a mount point with the specified path and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes.
```sh
VOLUME ["/data"]
```
- **EXPOSE:** Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
```sh
EXPOSE $APP_PORT
```
- **CMD:** Provides the command to run within the container when it starts.
```sh
 CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```
- **ENTRYPOINT:** Configures a container that will run as an executable.
```sh
ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```
- **HEALTHCHECK:** Informs Docker on how to test the container to check that it is still working.
```sh
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 CMD curl -f http://localhost:$APP_PORT/ || exit 1
```
- **STOPSIGNAL:** Sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
```sh
 STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM
```
## CMD Command
#### CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]:
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
- executable: This is the command or executable that will run inside the container (e.g., node, python, java, etc.) <br>
- param1 and param2: These are arguments passed to the executable.<br>
  Executable: java
  The container will invoke the java command, which is the Java runtime.<br>
  Arguments:
  -jar tells the Java runtime to treat the file at app.jar as a JAR file and run it.<br>
  app.jar is the path to the actual application JAR file.<br>
  java -jar command to run the java application.<br>

## CMD VS ENTRYPOINT 
- CMD can easily be overridden when running the container with different commands.<br>
```sh
root@ip-172-31-37-89:~/dockerfile/cmd# cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "Hello, world!"]
root@ip-172-31-37-89:~/dockerfile/cmd# docker run cmd echo hello new
hello, new
The container will then execute the command echo "hello, new" instead of the default echo "Hello, World!"
```
- The ENTRYPOINT instruction sets the command that will be executed when the container starts, and it cannot be easily overridden by docker run. 
   However, you can pass additional arguments to it when running the container.<br>
```sh
root@ip-172-31-37-89:~/dockerfile/entry# cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello"]
root@ip-172-31-37-89:~/dockerfile/entry# docker run entry world
Hello world
```

## Best Practices for Docker image creation/Best Practice Writing a Dockerfile <br>
- Intermediate build artifacts can be copied between the stages using the COPY --from instruction. This technique helps to reduce
the images size by excluding build tools and dependencies from the final image. <br>
-  Use specific tags:                   Avoid latest to ensure predictable builds and compatibility. <br>
-  Optimize image size:                 Use minimal base images and multi-stage builds to reduce the image footprint. <br>
```sh
# Stage 1: Build Dependencies  
FROM python:3.11-alpine AS build                  # Use lightweight Python 3.11 Alpine image  
WORKDIR /app                                       # Set working directory inside the container  
COPY requirements.txt .                            # Copy dependencies file to the container  
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies without caching  

# Stage 2: Production  
FROM python:3.11-alpine                                #  Use a fresh Python 3.11 Alpine image for production  
WORKDIR /app                                         # Set working directory inside the container  
COPY --from=build /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages  # Copy installed dependencies  
COPY . .                           # Copy application source code  
CMD ["python", "app.py"]           # Run the application  


```

```sh                                 
                  # Stage 1: Build
                  FROM node:18-alpine AS build  
                  WORKDIR /usr/src/app  
                  COPY package*.json ./  # Copy package files separately to leverage Docker cache  
                  RUN npm ci --omit=dev    # Use 'ci' for deterministic installs and omit dev dependencies  
                  COPY . .                # Copy the rest of the app files  
                  RUN npm run build        # Build the application  

                  # Stage 2: Production
                  FROM nginx:alpine AS production  
                  WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html  
                  RUN rm -rf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf          # Remove default nginx configuration  
                  COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/                 # Copy custom nginx configuration  
                  COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build .             # Copy built files from the build stage  
                  RUN chmod -R 755 /usr/share/nginx/html \  
                      && chown -R nginx:nginx /usr/share/nginx/html  # Set permissions to prevent unauthorized writes  
                  EXPOSE 80  # Expose port 80  
                  CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]                   # Start nginx  

                    Explaination:  In this example, the first stage builds the application, and the second stage uses an Nginx server to serve the built application. This approach keeps the final image lean and efficient.
```
-  Exclude unnecessary files:  Use .dockerignore to avoid sending unneeded files in the building the image.<br>
                                        Ignore Git-related files & log files  <br>
                                              .git/  <br>
                                              .gitignore  <br>
                                              *.log  <br>
-  Keep images secure:                  Regularly update base images to include the latest security patches.
-  Scan for vulnerabilities:            Use tools like Trivy or Docker built-in scan before deployment to ensure security compliance.
-  Try to avoid RUN apt get update -y or yum update -y in the Dockerfile.
-  File which so often change should be written at the end of the file. If index.html changes frequently and is near the top, Docker rebuilds everything after it — even if the rest didn't change. # example : COPY target/index.html /tmp/index.html


### Dockerfile for Python FrameWork
```sh
 FROM python:3.8-slim 
 WORKDIR /app  
 COPY ./python1 /app 
 RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  
 CMD ["python", "app.py"] 
```
 - Specifies the base image with Python 3.8.  base image will underlying environment in which your application will run                                  
 - Sets the working directory inside the container to /app                    
- Copies the content of the local directory /python1 on the host machine to the containers working directory.     
- Installs Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
- Uses the exec form to specify that the container should run the Python application app.py by default. 
- python app.py is command to run the python script on ubuntu/centos linux machine directly. 
                      
Environment= python:3.8-slim<br>
Dependencies= install -r requirements.txt <br>
Source Code= ./python1 <br>

### Dockerfile for Java Framework
```sh
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine  
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./target/*.jar /app/app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"] 
```
- lightweight OpenJDK 8 Alpine-based image, suitable for running Java applications to keep docker image size minimal.                                  
- /app directory is created in the container and All subsequent commands will be run from this directory.          
- Copies .jar from the target folder on the local machine inside the /app directory inside the container 
- This specifies the command to run when the container starts.CMD and ENTRYPOINT only excutes when container starts .
- java -jar app.jar is command to run the java script on ubuntu/centos linux machine directly.
### Dockerfile for Nodejs Framework
```sh
FROM node:14 
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000 
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```                          
- This specifies the base image. We are  using the official Node.js 14 image here. It includes Node.js and npm pre-installed.                             
- This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. All subsequent commands will be run from this directory.           
- This copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container. These files contain information about the project dependencies                 
- This installs the dependencies listed in package.json inside the container                          
- This copies the rest of your application code (everything in the current directory) into the /app directory inside the container                        
- This can be ingored . because we expose the application in particular port number. By default, all container ports are accessible from the container itself and can be mapped to any port on the host.                 
- node app.js command used to start the nodejs  application on the local linux machine.  <br>
  If your application defines a start script in package.json, you can run it using npm start <br>
```sh                                        
                                        package.json 
                                          {
                                              "scripts": {
                                            "start": "node app.js"
                                            }
                                           }
```

- **To list all files in the directory and display details about myfile.txt, you can use a shell form or exec form in CMD**
```sh
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
CMD ["sh", "-c", "ls -la && ls -la myfile.txt"]
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]:
```
- executable: This is the command or executable that will run inside the container (e.g., node, python, java, etc.) <br>
param1 and param2: These are arguments passed to the executable. <br>
### RUN COMMAND
- RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && touch /file2.txt  <br>
    Run instruction in a Dockerfile is used to execute shell commands during the build process of the image <br>
    You don’t need sudo in a Dockerfile, because commands are typically run as the root user by default in a Docker image <br>
    RUN command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the Docker image. This means that frequent RUN commands can increase the size of your image<br>
